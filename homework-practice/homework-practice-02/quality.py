def compute_precision(reference: List[LabeledAlignment], predicted: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Computes the numerator and the denominator of the precision for predicted alignments.
    Numerator : |predicted and possible|
    Denominator: |predicted|
    Note that for correct metric values `sure` needs to be a subset of `possible`, but it is not the case for input data.

    Args:
        reference: list of alignments with fields `possible` and `sure`
        predicted: list of alignments, i.e. lists of tuples (source_pos, target_pos)

    Returns:
        intersection: number of alignments that are both in predicted and possible sets, summed over all sentences
        total_predicted: total number of predicted alignments over all sentences

    Please use compute_precision and compute_recall to reduce code duplication.
